    "Develop an algorithm which will be used by a vending machine to dispense change. The cost of the item can be any amount up to five dollars and we will assume that the machine only accepts 5 dollar bills and returns change using the highest form of currency first, the dollar bill, followed by quarters then dimes, then nickels, and finally pennies. So if an item costs $ 1.65 the machine will return three 1 dollar bills and one quarter and 1 dime. Print “Insert More Money” if the amount entered is less than cost of the item selected for vending, otherwise dispense correct change."
